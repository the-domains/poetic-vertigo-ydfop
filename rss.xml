After months-nearly five of them in fact-of waiting, Marvel's one-shot comic, revealing just why C-3PO has a red arm for most of The Force Awakens, is finally here.

Only governments have had spacecraft, and there have been only a few, government-controlled, space stations to visit. But now that may finally changing in a big way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d83d67a7d53a5e25e15266ea03dab94cba53ee33.jpg"></article>]]></description>
